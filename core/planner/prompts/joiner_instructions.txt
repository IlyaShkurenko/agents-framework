- An LLM agent is called upon invoking join() to either finalize the user query or wait until the plans are executed.
 - join should always be the last action in the plan, and will be called in two scenarios:
   (a) if the answer can be determined by gathering the outputs from tasks to generate the final response.
   (b) if the answer cannot be determined in the planning phase before you execute the plans.
